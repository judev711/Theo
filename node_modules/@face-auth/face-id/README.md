# Introduction
[Face-Auth](https://face-auth.me) is a robust facial recognition authentication system designed for seamless integration into web applications. It enables secure and user-friendly login experiences by leveraging cutting-edge face recognition technology.

The `@face-auth/face-id` package simplifies the integration of facial recognition-based authentication into your web applications. It provides seamless access to Face-Auth's powerful APIs.

# Quick Starting Example


This example shows the basics of how to use the package. With these simple steps, you can start testing the platform right away.

## Install the package from command line

```shell
npm install @face-auth/face-id
```

## Import the package and create the API's invoker


```typescript
import { FaceId } from "@face-auth/face-id";

// Your registered domain in the platform.
// For testing purpose you can use 4demo.face-auth.me.
const domain = '4demo.face-auth.me';

// Your client token generated by the platform.
// For testing purpose you can use 6f08e5f7-c72c-44fe-9361-e3234164754b.
const clientToken = '6f08e5f7-c72c-44fe-9361-e3234164754b';

const faceId = new FaceId(domain, clientToken);
```

## Register a new face

Given a HTML canvas:

```html
<canvas id="canvas" width="5" height="5"></canvas>
```

We can register the face with:
```typescript
// Get the canvas object
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");

// Identification used to register the face
const faceIdentifier = 'face_id_123';
// Format type of the image
const imageType = 'image/png';

// Convert canvas to blob async to register the face
canvas.toBlob(async (blob) => {
  const response = await faceId.register(faceIdentifier, blob, imageType);
  console.log("Success: ", response.success); // boolean
  console.log("Domain: ", response.data.domain); // string
  console.log("Face identifier: ", response.data.faceId); // string
}, imageType);
```

## Identify an already registered face

Given a HTML canvas:

```html
<canvas id="canvas" width="5" height="5"></canvas>
```

We can identify the face with:
```typescript
// Get the canvas object
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");

// Format type of the image
const imageType = 'image/png';

// Convert canvas to blob async to register the face
canvas.toBlob(async (blob) => {
  const response = await faceId.identify(blob, imageType);
  console.log("Success: ", response.success); // boolean
  console.log("Face identified: ", response.data.found); // boolean
  console.log("Face identifier: ", response.data.faceId); // string
}, imageType);
```

**Note:** For a production setup, follow the detailed steps to register a domain and generate your own unique token, ensuring optimal performance.

# Getting started
